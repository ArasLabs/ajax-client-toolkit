# AJAX toolkit for Browser Independent Clients

This is a toolkit/framework for building specialized clients using AJAX and any browser.

The download includes a small sample application and some libraries and sample code which can be used to develop your own browser independent clients. The sample application is intended to show some of the techniques that should be used and is not intended to be a production client.

We are interested in your feedback and contributions to this library.

See the README file in the download for more info.
